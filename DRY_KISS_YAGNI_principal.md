`DRY, KISS, YAGNI Principals`
Those ate three principal that every developer should care because it is about clean code.

`DRY (Don't Repeat yourself)`

- This means that you should not have duplicated code
- It’s easier to maintain a code that is only in one place, because if you need to change something in the code, you just need to change in one place.
- Duplicated code also makes the code more complex and unnecessarily larger.
- You also should not write ambiguous code. Your classes, your variables, your functions, they should have a specific name, and their name must match their responsibility.
- It means that it’s not only about copy and past code — yes, this is also included - but goes beyond that. It‘s also about having different code that does the same thing. Maybe you can have different code in two or more places, but they do the same thing in different ways, this also should be avoided.

`KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) `

- This principle says about to make your code simple. You should avoid unnecessary complexity. A simple code it’s easier to maintain and easier to understand.
- You should eliminate duplicated code, should remove unnecessary features, don’t use unnecessary variables and methods, use names for variables and methods that makes sense and matches their responsibilities, and always when it’s possible, follow know standards of code development.

`YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need it)`

- It’s a principle from software development methodology of Extreme Programming (XP).
- This principle says that you should not create features that it’s not really necessary.
- This principle it’s similar to the KISS principle, once that both of them aim for a simpler solution. The difference between them it’s that YAGNI focus on removing unnecessary functionality and logic, and KISS focus on the complexity.
- It means that you should not implement functionality just because you think that you may need it someday, but implement it just when you really need it.
